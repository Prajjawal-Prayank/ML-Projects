#About
This is a Deep Neural Network model for Character Recognition. Convolutional Neural Network is used . The model uses two convolutional 
layers , two pooling layers and a fully connected layer. 

#Dataset
The EMNIST (or, Extended MNIST) dataset is used for training and testing of the model. The data could be found in the "emnist_data" folder.
In the "input_images" folder are some images used for checking the prediction capabilitie of the model.
