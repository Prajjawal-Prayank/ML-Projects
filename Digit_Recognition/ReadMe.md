# About
This is a project for recognizing the digit in a given picture. Two different approaches are tried. One is based on Convolutional Neural Network and the other on Softmax Regression . The models are trained and tested on the MNIST dataset (as is already present in tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist module ).
